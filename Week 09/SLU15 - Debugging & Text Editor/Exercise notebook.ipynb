    "Our main task is to write a program that reads a text file that contains a list of numbers, calculates a \"moving average\" of that list, and writes the results to another text file named `result.txt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "What we mean by a \"moving average\" is clear from the following example. If we want to calculate the averages of a list of numbers `[1, 2, 6, 3]`, we should begin with the first `[1]`, and the average of that number by itself is `1`. Then, we include the next number and calculate the average of `[1, 2]`, which is `1.5`. We add the next number, and the average of `[1, 2, 6]` becomes `3`. Finally, with the last number in the list, and the average of `[1, 2, 6, 3]` is `3`. The result of these moving averages, if we put them in another list, is `[1, 1.5, 3, 3]`.\n",

    "\n",
    "Let's make things even more interesting and force ourselves to implement the moving average calcuations ourselves, so we shouldn't use functions like len(), sum(), mean() for our calculations. It's okay to use these functions in any other situations, or course, but we want to test ourselves here. "
