# Weekly workflow

**Each week** on Monday a new directory will be released on the [`ds-prep-course-2025`](https://github.com/LDSSA/ds-prep-course-2025) repository. On **'week 1'** (March 25 - March 31), the directory released will be `Week 01`. On **'week 02'**, it will be called `Week 02`, and so on. These directories contain the learning units you'll be working on. The releases will be announced on Slack, on the **[#announcements](https://ldsaprepcourse2025.slack.com/archives/C08F7QPD2LB)** channel. Follow this guide to get and work on the learning materials.

## 1.1 Get the learning materials

This section only needs to be done **ONCE for each week**. It is about getting the materials and copying them to your **'local workspace'**.

**Step 1:** Open a **'terminal'** and change to the local `ds-prep-course-2025` repo:

```bash
cd ~/projects/ds-prep-course-2025/
```

**Step 2:** **Pull** new material from the **'remote repo'**:

```bash
git pull
```

**Step 3:** **Copy** the new material to your **'workspace directory'**.

**⚠️⚠️⚠️ Before running the command below:** - If the `"Week <week number>"` directory already exists in your workspace directory, **it will be replaced**, so make sure you do this **once** and before starting to work on the exercises. Also, make sure that you copy just the new week's directory **so that you don't overwrite your previous work**.

```bash
cp -r ~/projects/ds-prep-course-2025/"Week <week number>" ~/projects/ds-prep-workspace/
```

Note that we are using **quotes** in the path because it contains spaces. Example for `Week 01`:

```bash
cp -r ~/projects/ds-prep-course-2025/"Week 01" ~/projects/ds-prep-workspace/
```

If you're curious about how you can do this using your OS GUI [check this guide](docs/guides/using_os_gui_to_manage_directories.md)

## 1.2. Activate the `prep-venv` environment you created in the initial setup

```bash
source ~/.virtualenvs/prep-venv/bin/activate
```

## 1.3 Work on the learning units

All learning units come as a set of **'Jupyter Notebooks'**. These are documents that can contain **text**, **images** and **live code** that you can run interactively. You will learn how to use the **'Jupyter Notebooks'** in **'Week 00'**.

Navigate to your **'workspace directory'**:

```bash
cd ~/projects/ds-prep-workspace
```

Then follow the steps below.

**Step 1:** Open the **'Jupyter Notebook'** application by running:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

You should see something similar to this happening in your **'terminal'**:

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src='media//jupyter_terminal.png' alt='Alt text'  width="80%" />
</div>

and your browser should pop up with **'Jupyter notebook'** open. However, if this does not happen, you can simply **copy the link** you see on your terminal (the one that starts with `http://localhost`) and **paste** it in your **'browser's address bar'**.

**Note:** If you see some scary looking messages, don't worry, you can just ignore them.

**Step 2:** Work on the learning unit (**SLU**).

⚠️ **Important:** **ALWAYS** work on the files in your `ds-prep-workspace` repository. **<span style="color: red;">NEVER</span>** work on the files inside in the `ds-prep-course-2025` repository!

- Study the **'Learning Notebook'**. You can interact with the notebook and try out the code.

- Complete the tasks in the **'Exercise Notebook'**. Don't forget to save your work as you go along! Sometimes there will be more Exercise notebooks and they will be numbered. In that case, if you are a complete beginner, start with notebook 0, then proceed to notebook 1. If you are planning to apply for the Starters academy, complete also notebook 2. You can skip notebook 0 if you already have some programming experience.

> 📝 **Note:** You may eventually also find **'Extra Notebooks'** and **'Example Notebooks'** in some **SLU**s

> ⚠️ **Reminder:** Save your work regularly! Although **'Jupyter Notebook'** autosaves your documents, it may encounter issues and disable autosave without warning, risking loss of work if you exit without saving.


<span id="link-to-grading"></span>**Step 3:** Grading and submiting the exercise notebook

> ❗ **IMPORTANT:** The LDSA Prep-course portal (where you'll be submitting your weekly work to) **will open Friday, 21/03/2025**. Please **don't try to submit your work before that date**.

Once you've solved all the exercises, we recommend following this simple checklist to avoid unexpected surprises:

1.  Save the Exercise notebook (again)
2.  Run "Restart & Run All"

    <div style="text-align: center;">
      <img src='media//jupyter_clear_and_run.png' alt='Alt text' />
    </div>

3.  **Ensure that the last cell of the notebook has been executed** as represented by a number between brackets beside the top left of the cell. If instead of a number you see a '\*', the cell is still busy and the exercise notebook is not ready for submission.

    <div style="text-align: center;">
      <img src='media//notebook_busy_cell.png' alt='Alt text' />
    </div>

4.  At this point the notebook should have run without any error messages showing up.

    <div style="text-align: center;">
      <img src='media//terminal_notebook.png' alt='Alt text' width="70%" />
    </div>

5.  Close all the notebooks, return to the terminal and stop the notebook server by typing `Ctrl+C+C` (`Ctrl` and two times `C` ).



6.  Get your Slack ID (read [this](https://moshfeu.medium.com/how-to-find-my-member-id-in-slack-workspace-d4bba942e38c) if you don't know where to find it) and submit the notebook to the [portal](https://prep-course.lisbondatascience.org/). **The virtual environment has to be activated and you have be in the learning unit directory!**

7. Make sure that you are in the correct SLU directory:

    ```bash
    cd ~/projects/ds-prep-workspace/"Week <week number>"/"<SLU name>"
    ```

    **Example:** For **'Week 00'** you'd do:

    ```bash
    cd ~/projects/ds-prep-workspace/"Week 00"/"SLU00 - Jupyter Notebook"
    ```

8. Submit the notebook to the portal, replacing `<YOUR_SLACK_ID>` with your actual Slack ID:

     - If the SLU has a single exercise notebook use:

        ```bash
        python submit.py --notebook "Exercise notebook" --slackid "<YOUR_SLACK_ID>"
        ```

      - If the SLU has multiple exercise notebooks they will be numbered, in which case you should include the number of each exercise notebook in the respective submission like this:
       
        ```bash
        python submit.py --notebook "Exercise notebook <NUMBER>" --slackid "YOUR_SLACK_ID"
        ```

        Example for "Exercise notebook 1":

        ```bash
        python submit.py --notebook "Exercise notebook 1" --slackid "YOUR_SLACK_ID"
        ```

      > ❗ **IMPORTANT:** If the submission process fails with a reference to a missing module, replace `python` with `python3.13` in the previous command(s) and try again.

      It can take a while for the submission to get through. If it worked out, you should get a message like this one. You will see your grade (score) and the learning unit number.

      ```bash
      20.0
      {'learning_unit': 0, 'exercise_notebook': 1, 'slackid': 'U04ST63FC02', 'score': 20.0}
      Success!
      {"id":10,"created":"2023-03-26T00:40:17.603128Z", "slackid":"U04ST63FC02", "learning_unit" 0, "exercise_notebook":1, "score":20.0}
      ```

Your submission should now be on the [portal](https://prep-course.lisbondatascience.org/). The submissions are ordered by the learning unit number, then chronologically. The easiest way to find your submission is to search for your Slack ID. Use `Ctrl+F` to search for your Slack ID. You can then click on your Slack ID to see all your submissions.

**Step 4:** **'Commit'** and **'push'**

Now is the time to transfer your work from the **'local workspace'** repo to the **'remote workspace'** repo on **'GitHub'**.

1.  Open a **'terminal'** and navigate to your **'local workspace'**:

    ```bash
    cd ~/projects/ds-prep-workspace
    ```

2.  These steps will take a snapshot of your **'local workspace'** in this moment in time and transfer it to your **'remote workspace'** repo. You will understand them once your have studied SLU03.

    ```bash
    git add .
    ```

    ```bash
    git commit -m "Exercises for Week <week number>"
    ```

    ```bash
    git push
    ```

You'll be asked for your **'Git'** username and password - enter your **'token'** for the password.

## 1.4. Updates of the learning units

As much as we try and have processes in place to prevent errors and bugs in the learning units, some make it through to you.

If the problem is **not in the 'Exercise notebook'** you can just pull the new version from the `ds-prep-course-2025` repo and replace the file in your `ds-prep-workspace` (steps 1 and 2 from [section 1.1](#11-get-the-learning-materials)). Make sure to replace **just the new file** and not overwrite any work you already did in the exercise notebook.

If the correction is in the **'Exercise notebook'**, however, **you can't just replace the file because your work is there and you'll lose it**!

When a new version of the **'Exercise notebook'** is released (and announced) you will have to copy the work you already did to the new version of the notebook:

1. Rename the old exercise notebook;
1. Copy the new exercise notebook over;
1. Open both exercise notebooks and copy paste your solutions to the new notebook.

We understand that it's not ideal and we are working on improving this workflow.
