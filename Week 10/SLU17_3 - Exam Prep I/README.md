# SLU17_3 - Exam Prep I

This learning unit is for you to practice solving the previous entry exams of the [Lisbon Data Science Starters Academy](https://www.lisbondatascience.org/starters-academy/).

The SLU17_3 contains one exercise notebook with all the questions from the wave 2 entry exam of batch 06 of LDSSA.

You can solve the exam just like a normal exercise notebook or you can pretend that it's an exam. To make it more real this time, we allocated 3 hours of time for the exam today and an office hour afterwards where you can talk to us about any doubts you have. Good luck!

## How to go through this SLU?

1. Follow the [Learning Unit Workflow](https://github.com/LDSSA/ds-prep-course-2025/blob/main/docs/weekly-workflow.md).
2. Go through the learning notebooks.
3. Do the exercise notebooks, and submit them, as usual.

## "I need help understanding something"

You can and should ask for help, whether it's regarding learning notebooks, exercises, or anything else. Please check out the [How to Ask for Help](https://github.com/LDSSA/ds-prep-course-2025/blob/main/docs/slack.md), and remember **not to share code when asking for help about the exercises!**
