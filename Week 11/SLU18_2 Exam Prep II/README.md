# SLU18_2 - Exam Prep II

This learning unit is for you to practice solving the previous entry exams of the Lisbon Data Science Starters Academy.

The SLU18_2 contains one exercise notebook with all the questions from the entry exam of batch 4 of LDSSA.

You can solve the exam just like a normal exercise notebook or you can pretend that it's an exam (3-hour deadline). In the second case, it's advisable to find some distraction-free time.

Happy coding!
